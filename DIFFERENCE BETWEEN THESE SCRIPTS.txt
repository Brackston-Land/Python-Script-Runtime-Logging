*******WriteToExcel_openpyxl.py******** 
Was the first script I tried. The 
openpyxl module overwrites the excel file each time so it does 
not maintain parameters that you set in charts and stuff.



*****SuperSimple_WriteToExcel_win32.py******** 
This is just a super simple script
showing how to write to cells with win32 module. In order to use
the win32 module, you need to install pywin32 (if that doesn't work 
install pypiwin32)

also attrs (if that doesn't work try attr)

*******WriteToExcel_win32.py*******
Final script for writting start and end times of scripts to excel sheet.
Also writes to excel sheet if there is an error in the script. This script should
be placed in the Lib fil location of the python environment being used so that 
it can be simply imported and used as a module. Ie.  Import WriteToExcel_win32.py



*********AddNet.py********* 
A script demonstrating how to call  and use the
WriteToExcel_win32.py script
